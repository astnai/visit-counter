# Visitor Count with Theme Detection

This project demonstrates a simple visitor counter integrated with theme detection functionality using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

# How It Works

- Visitor Counter: Tracks and displays the number of visits using local storage to persist the count across sessions.
- Theme Detection: Dynamically switches between light and dark themes based on the user's system preferences.
